# DivGen

Welcome to the homepage of `DivGen`, which is a tool implemented in `Binary Semantic Divergence-Directed Test Program Construction for Compiler Testing (Under Review)`


Description of current published code:


* `bcov` is used to generate the CFG of binary
* `live_instrumenter` is used to instrument test program
* `test-main/pydot-test-main.py` is the main python script used to construct test programs and perform compiler testing
* `test-main/se-confirm-v3.py` is the main python script used to perform binary symbolic execution with `Angr`

**We will provide a more detailed set-up tutorial and usage of `DivGen` after acceptance. Thanks.**
